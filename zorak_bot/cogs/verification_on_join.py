Hi there, {member.mention}
I'm Zorak, the moderatior of {guild.name}.

We are very happy that you have decided to join us.
Before you are allowed to chat, you need to verify that you aren't a bot.
Dont worry, it's easy. Just go to {bot.get_channel(953545059888930816).mention} and click the green button.

After you do, all of {guild.name} is availibe to you. Have a great time :-)
