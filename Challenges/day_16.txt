**Day 16: Sum the List **
Write a function called sum_list with one parameter that takes a nested list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of the integers. For example, if you pass [[2, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 5, 6]] as an argument your function should return a sum of 33.
**Extra Challenge: Unpack A Nest Nested_list = [[12, 34, 56, 67], [34, 68, 78]] **
Write a code that generates a list of the following numbers from the nested list above – 34, 67, 78. Your output should be another list: [34, 67, 78]. The list output should not have duplicates.
