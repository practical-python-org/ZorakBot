**Day 6: User-Name Generator**
Write a function called user_name that generates a username from the userâ€™s email. The code should ask the user to input an email and the code should return everything before the @ sign as their user name. For example, if someone enters ben@gmail.com, the code should return ben as their user name.
**Extra Challenge: Zero Both ends**
Write a function called zeroed code that takes a list of numbers as an argument. The code should zero (0) the first and the last number in the list. For example, if the input is [2, 5, 7, 8, 9], your code should return [0, 5, 7, 8, 0].
