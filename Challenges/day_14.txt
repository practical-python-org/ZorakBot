**Day 14: Flatten the List**
Write a function called flat_list that takes one argument, a nested list. The function converts the nested list into a one- dimension list. For example [[2,4,5,6]] should return [2,4,5,6].
**Extra Challenge: Teacher’s Salary**
A school has asked you to write a program that will calculate teachers' salaries. The program should ask the user to enter the teacher’s name, the number of periods taught in a month, and the rate per period. The monthly salary is calculated by multiplying the number of periods by the monthly rate. The current monthly rate per period is $20. If a teacher has more than 100 periods in a month, everything above 100 is overtime. Overtime is $25 per period. For example, if a teacher has taught 105 periods, their monthly gross salary should be 2,125. Write a function called your_salary that calculates a teacher’s gross salary. The function should return the teacher’s name, periods taught, and gross salary. Here is how you should format your output:
Teacher: John Kelly, Periods: 105 Gross salary:2,125
