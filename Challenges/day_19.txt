**Day 19: Words and Elements **
Write two functions. The first function is called count_words which takes a string of words and counts how many words are in the string.
The second function called count_elements takes a string of words and counts how many elements are in the string. Do not count the whitespaces. The first function will return the number of words in a string and the second one will return the number of elements (less whitespace). If you pass ‘I love learning’, the count_words function should return 3 words and count_elements should return 13 elements.
