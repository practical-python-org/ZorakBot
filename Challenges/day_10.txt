**Day 10: Hide my Password**
Write a function called hide_password that takes no parameters. The function takes an input (a password) from a user and returns a hidden password. For example, if the user enters ‘hello’ as a password the function should return ‘****’ as a password and tell the user that the password is 4 characters long.
**Extra Challenge: A Thousand Separator**
Your new company has a list of figures saved in a list. The issue is that these numbers have no separator. The numbers are saved in the following format:
[1000000, 2356989, 2354672, 9878098].
You have been asked to write a code that will convert each of the numbers in the list into a string. Your code should then add a comma on each number as a thousand separator for readability. When you run your code on the above list, your output should be:
[ '1,000,000', '2,356,989', '2,354,672', '9,878,098’]
Write a function called convert_numbers that will take one argument, a list of numbers above.
