**Day 20: Capitalize First Letter **
Write a function called capitalize. This function takes a string as an argument and capitalizes the first letter of each word. For example, ‘i like learning’ becomes ‘I Like Learning’.

You are given a string of words. Some of the words in the string contain uppercase letters. Write a code that will return all the words that have an uppercase letter. Your code should return a list of the words. Each word in the list should be reversed. Here is how your output should look:
