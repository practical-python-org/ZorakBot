**Day 4: Only Floats**
Write a function called only_floats, which takes two parameters a and b, and returns 2 if both arguments are floats, returns 1 if only one argument is a float, and returns 0 if neither argument is a float. If you pass (12.1, 23) as an argument, your function should return a 1.
**Extra Challenge: Index of the Longest Word**
Write a function called word_index that takes one argument, a list of strings and returns the index of the longest word in the list. If there is no longest word (if all the strings are of the same length), the function should return zero (0). For example, the list below should return 2.
words1 = ["Hate", "remorse", "vengeance"] And this list below, shoul return zero (0)
words2 = ["Love", "Hate"]
